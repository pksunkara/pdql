This project is called as PDQL. It means PHP based Database and Query Language.
Generally we use Mysql with PHP to create web applications. But PHP can also be used to create some application in Linux using the php-cli program. When we are creating such a type of program, we need Mysql or some other Database structure to use it. 
Also when u design a small database web application, you can use this if you find using a big database like MySql is absolutely unnecessary.
One another instance for a great use of this is when your run out of number of databases in your web host.
