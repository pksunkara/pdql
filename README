This project is called as PDQL. It means PHP based Database and Query Language.
* Generally we use Mysql with PHP to create web applications. But PHP can also be used to create some application in Linux using the php-cli program. When we are creating such a type of program, we need Mysql or some other Database program to use it. This can be used in such cases. 
* Also when u design a small database web application, you can use this if you find using a big database program like MySql is absolutely unnecessary.
* One another instance for a great use of this is when your run out of number of databases in your web host.
